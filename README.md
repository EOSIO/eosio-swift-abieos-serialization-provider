ABIEOS Serialization Provider is a pluggable serialization provider for [EOSIO SDK for Swift](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift).

Serialization providers are responsible for ABI-driven transaction and action serialization and deserialization between JSON and binary data representations. This particular serialization provider wraps [ABIEOS](https://github.com/EOSIO/abieos), a C/C++ library that facilitates this conversion.

## Prerequisites

* Xcode 10 or higher
* CocoaPods 1.5.3 or higher
* For iOS, iOS 12+

This project relies on platform functionality only present in iOS 12+. Therefore, any project depending on ABIEOS Serialization Provider with [EOSIO SDK for Swift](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift) **must be an iOS 12+ project**. Other serialization providers, however, can be created to support iOS 11. If your project requires iOS 11 support, or if you'd like to create a serialization provider and have questions, please reach out to us by [logging an issue](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift-abieos-serialization-provider/issues/new).

## Installation

ABIEOS Serialization Provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Swift](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift) as a provider plugin.

To use ABIEOS Serialization Provider with EOSIO SDK for Swift in your app, add the following pods to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html):

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target "Your Target" do
  pod "EosioSwift", "~> 0.1.1" # EOSIO SDK for Swift core library
  pod "EosioSwiftAbieos", "~> 0.1.1" # pod for this library
  # add other providers for EOSIO SDK for Swift
  pod "EosioSwiftSoftkeySignatureProvider", "~> 0.1.1" # experimental provider for development only
end
```

Then run `pod install`.

Now ABIEOS Serialization Provider is ready for use within EOSIO SDK for Swift according to the [EOSIO SDK for Swift Basic Usage instructions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-swift/tree/master#basic-usage).

## Direct Usage

If you wish to use ABIEOS Serialization Provider directly, its public methods can be called like this:

```swift
let abieos: EosioAbieosSerializationProvider? = EosioAbieosSerializationProvider()
let hex = "1686755CA99DE8E73E1200" // some binary data
let json = "{"name": "John"}" // some JSON

let jsonToBinaryTransaction = try? abieos?.serializeTransaction(json: json)
let binaryToJsonTransaction = try? abieos?.deserializeTransaction(hex: hex)
```
